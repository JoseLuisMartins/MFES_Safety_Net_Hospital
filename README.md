# MFES_Safety_Net_Hospital

## Safety Net Hospital
In this project you have to model all the information needed to manage a Safety Net Hospital. Safety
net hospitals provide care for populations which are of low-income, traditionally exploited, receiving
public assistance, and uninsured. Safety net hospitals are not defined by their ownership terms; rather
they are more devoted to providing the best possible care for those who are barred from health care
due to various circumstances. With this system, it should be possible to know the doctors of an
hospital, the doctors that work in more than one hospital, the hospital with higher number of
appointments, among others.
